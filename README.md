# ALZ Custom Naming Convention
This repo serves as an example of how to use the [ALZ Terraform module](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-caf-enterprise-scale) with custom naming convention for management groups, resource groups and resources

- To see how to rename management groups, see the `custom_landing_zones` block code in the main.tf file

- To see how to rename resource groups and resource, see the `advanced` block code in the settings.connectivity.tf and the settings.management.tf files.
